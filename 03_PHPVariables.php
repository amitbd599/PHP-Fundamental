/*  

    ! Rules for PHP variables:
        * A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
        * A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
        * A variable name cannot start with a number
        * A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
        * Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)


    ! Write Way:
        $firstname
        $_firstname 
        $first_name
        $first-name
        $firstName
        $firstname99

    ! Wrong Way 
        $first name 
        $99firstname
        $first%name
